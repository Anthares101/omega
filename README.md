# Omega - From Wordpress admin to pty

The Linux tool to automate the process of getting a pty once you got admin credentials in a Wordpress site. Works in Linux, Windows and MacOS hosts! 

The shell code used for Windows hosts is a modified version of the [PHP reverse shell](https://github.com/ivan-sincek/php-reverse-shell/blob/master/src/php_reverse_shell.php) by [ivan-sincek](https://github.com/ivan-sincek), credits to the author.

![Omega getting a pty to a Wordpress host](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/anthares101/omega/master/assets/demo.gif)

## How does it work?

First, Omega gets an admin session in the Wordpress site and using web scrapping, it extracts the current template used by Wordpress. After that, it will use the template editor to inject a payload with a simple web shell and a base64 PHP code evaluation function.

Once everything is set up, Omega will spin up a listener, execute a reverse shell using the payload injected and wait for the shell to connect back. Before giving the control to the user, Omega will try to stabilize the shell and get a pty (Only for Linux and MacOS hosts).

If stabilization is not possible using the methods Omega has, a non tty shell will be provided that can be stabilized without problems using any method you want.

## Installation

Just execute `pip3 install omega-wp` and enjoy! You can use a virtual env or intall it system wide.

## Usage

If you have all the requirements you can start playing with Omega!
